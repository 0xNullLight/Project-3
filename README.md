This branch is deditcated to learning Django; it is not associated directly with the project aside from it being a guide to understanding the thought process as we're learning both python/django.

**Note from Bee Vang:**

Team members are free to add/create/edit/remove markdowns, just make sure to make changes on the **notes.js** so it shows the markdown is selectable to be viewed on the page.
