This branch is deditcated to learning Django & along the way, some stuff about python.
It is not associated directly with the project aside from it being a guide to understanding the thought process as we're learning both python/django.

**Note from Bee Vang:**
Along the way, if I remember anything useful I learnt over the years, I will post it up here too.
I encourage everyone to view these [exspecially the one about navigating python](https://github.com/0xNullLight/Project-3/blob/Learning-Django/markdown/Navigating_Python_&_Jupyter_Lab_Extension:The_Essential_Functions_You_Won%27t_Find_in_Textbooks.md).

Team members are free to add/create/edit/remove markdowns, just make sure to make changes on the **notes.js** so it shows the markdown is selectable to be viewed on the page.
