### **Django Installation and Setting up a Project**

### **Step 1: Install Django**

Before starting, make sure Django is installed in your development environment.

1.  **Create a virtual environment**:
    
    -   On **Windows**:
        
        ```bash
        python -m venv myenv
        
        ```
        
    -   On **macOS/Linux**:
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv myenv
        
        ```
        
2.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    
    -   On **Windows**:
        
        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        
        ```
        
    -   On **macOS/Linux**:
        
        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        
        ```
        
3.  **Install Django**: With the virtual environment activated, install Django using `pip`:
    
    ```bash
    pip install django
    
    ```

### **Step 2: Create a New Django Project**

1.  **Create a new Django project** named `project_3` by running:
    
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject project_3
    
    ```
    
2.  Navigate into the newly created project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd project_3
    
    ```
    
3.  This will generate the following folder structure:
    
    ```
    project_3/
        manage.py
        project_3/
            __init__.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            asgi.py
            wsgi.py
    
    ```
    

----------

### **Step 3: Understanding the Files Generated by `startproject`**

#### **`manage.py`**

-   **Purpose**: Command-line tool for managing your project, including running the server, migrations, and other tasks.
-   **Usage**: To start the server:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    
    ```
    

#### **`project_3/` Directory**

-   **`__init__.py`**: Marks the folder as a Python package.
-   **`settings.py`**: Contains your project’s settings (e.g., database configuration, static files).
-   **`urls.py`**: Maps URLs to views.
-   **`asgi.py` and `wsgi.py`**: For asynchronous and WSGI-compatible deployment.

----------

### **Step 4: Running the Development Server**

1.  **Start the development server**: In the `project_3` directory (where `manage.py` is), run:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    
    ```
    
2.  Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the Django welcome page.
    

----------

### **Step 5: Creating a New Django App**

A Django project typically consists of multiple apps. To create an app within the project:

1.  **Create a new app** called `base`:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py startapp base
    
    ```
    
2.  This will create the following structure inside the `base` directory:
    
    ```
    base/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
        migrations/
            __init__.py
    
    ```
    
    -   **`models.py`**: Defines the app’s database models.
    -   **`views.py`**: Contains views that handle HTTP requests.
    -   **`admin.py`**: Used for registering models to the Django admin interface.
    -   **`apps.py`**: Contains configuration for the app.
    -   **`tests.py`**: Defines unit tests for the app.
    -   **`migrations/`**: Stores database schema migration files.

----------

### **Step 6: Configuring the App in `settings.py`**

To enable the `base` app, add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` section of `settings.py`.

1.  Open `project_3/settings.py`.
2.  Add `'base'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
    
    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'base',  # Add this line
    ]
    
    ```
    

----------

### **Step 7: Creating a Simple View**

Let’s create a simple view in the `base` app that returns a welcome message.

1.  **Edit `base/views.py`**:
    
    ```python
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    
    def home(request):
        return HttpResponse("Welcome to Project 3!")
    
    ```
    
2.  **Update `urls.py`** to add a URL for this new view:
    
    -   Open `project_3/urls.py`.
    -   Add the following to map the `home` view:
    
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path
    from base import views  # Import views from the base app
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', views.home),  # Add this line to map the home view
    ]
    
    ```
    
3.  **Restart the server**:
    
    -   Stop the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` and restart it:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    
    ```
    
4.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to see the "Welcome to Project 3!" message.
    

----------

### **Conclusion**

You’ve successfully:

1.  Installed Django and set up a virtual environment.
2.  Created a new Django project and understood the generated files.
3.  Run the development server and created an app within the project.
4.  Created a simple view to display a welcome message.

This is the foundation for developing Django web applications. You can now explore further by adding more functionality to your app, such as templates, models, forms, and more!
