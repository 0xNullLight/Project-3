### **Step 1: Install Django**

If you haven't already, you'll need to install Django. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
   This will create a virtual environment named `myenv`. To activate it, use:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install Django**:
   Run the following command to install Django in your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

### **Step 2: Create a New Django Project**

A Django project is the main container for your app(s), settings, and configurations. To create a new project:

1. Run the following command to create a new project (replace `<project_name>` with your desired project name):
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```

2. **Navigate into your project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd myproject
   ```

   This will create a new folder named `myproject` with the following structure:

   ```
   myproject/
       manage.py
       myproject/
           __init__.py
           settings.py
           urls.py
           asgi.py
           wsgi.py
   ```

- **`manage.py`**: A command-line utility to interact with your project (running server, making migrations, etc.).
- **`myproject/settings.py`**: Configuration for your project (database settings, static files, etc.).
- **`myproject/urls.py`**: Defines the URL patterns (routes) for your project.
- **`myproject/asgi.py` and `wsgi.py`**: These files are used for deploying the project on web servers (don't need to worry about them for development).

---

### **Step 3: Run the Development Server**

Now that your project is set up, let's run the Django development server.

1. **Start the server** by running this command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. You should see something like:
   ```
   Watching for file changes with StatReloader
   Performing system checks...

   System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
   December 05, 2024 - 15:42:05
   Django version 4.1.0, using settings 'myproject.settings'
   Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should see the Django welcome page with a message saying, "The install worked successfully!"

### **Step 4: Create a New Django App**

In Django, apps are modules that contain related code for specific functionalities, like authentication, blog posts, or in our case, a simple `base` app.

1. **Create a new app** by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp base
   ```

   This will create a new folder called `base` with the following structure:

   ```
   base/
       __init__.py
       admin.py
       apps.py
       models.py
       tests.py
       views.py
       migrations/
           __init__.py
   ```

Let's go through these files and explain their purpose:

- **`__init__.py`**: This file marks the directory as a Python package.
- **`admin.py`**: Where you can register models for the Django admin interface.
- **`apps.py`**: Contains configuration for the app, such as the app’s name and any app-specific settings.
- **`models.py`**: Define the database models (tables). You write Python classes here, and Django will automatically convert them into database tables.
- **`tests.py`**: Define unit tests for your app. Django will run these tests to ensure everything works as expected.
- **`views.py`**: Define views, which are functions or classes that return HTTP responses (e.g., rendering HTML templates).
- **`migrations/`**: Directory where Django stores database migration files that track changes to the models.

---

### **Step 5: Add the App to Your Project**

Django needs to know that the `base` app exists and should be included in your project.

1. **Open the `settings.py` file** (located in `myproject/myproject/settings.py`).

2. **Find the `INSTALLED_APPS` section** and add `'base'` to the list:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       'django.contrib.admin',
       'django.contrib.auth',
       'django.contrib.contenttypes',
       'django.contrib.sessions',
       'django.contrib.messages',
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',
       'base',  # <-- add this line
   ]
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Create a Simple View**

Let's create a simple view in the `base` app.

1. **Edit `base/views.py`** to create a view:
   ```python
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   def home(request):
       return HttpResponse("Hello, welcome to the base app!")
   ```

2. **Map the view to a URL**:
   - Open the `urls.py` file in your `myproject` folder (`myproject/urls.py`).
   - Add a URL pattern that points to the `home` view:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path
   from base import views  # Import the views from the base app

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('', views.home),  # Map the home view to the root URL
   ]
   ```

3. **Restart the server** (if it's already running) by stopping it with `Ctrl+C` and then running `python manage.py runserver` again.

4. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your new view, which will display "Hello, welcome to the base app!".

### **Step 7: Create a Template (Optional)**

Instead of returning a simple HTTP response, you can return HTML templates.

1. **Create a new directory for templates** inside the `base` app:
   - Create a folder: `base/templates/base/`.
   - Inside that folder, create a file `home.html`:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Base App</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Hello, welcome to the base app!</h1>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

2. **Update the `views.py` to render the template**:
   ```python
   from django.shortcuts import render

   def home(request):
       return render(request, 'base/home.html')
   ```

3. **Restart the server** and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the template rendered in the browser.

### **Conclusion**

You've now set up a Django project, run the development server, created an app, and made a simple view and template. Django’s flexibility allows you to easily add more functionality, like models, forms, and authentication, to your project.

From here, you can continue learning by:
- Adding more views and templates.
- Working with models and databases.
- Using Django's admin interface to manage your app's data.
